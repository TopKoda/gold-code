Here's where I learn Python!

I'm a long time IT pro who lives in the UK. This is just a little personal repo to collect code snippets and demo scripts.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or see anything of interest.  Always happy to connect to enthusiatic and helpful folks!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, AWS CLI and Terraform.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a DevOps journey with Level Up In Tech.
- ðŸ˜€ I don't have much free time, but I'm trying to use it productively.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about tech or job hunting.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The gentleman in my banner is my favourite baddie from loads of old school kung fu movies - the mighty Hwang Jang-lee!
